<h1>About Art—ist</h1>

<p class="art-ist-text">Erik Eriksson aka Art—ist showed an interest in music ever since he first laid his hands on a cheap Yamaha-keyboard in his early childhood years. Evolving through composing bit music in his teenage years it was when Erik moved from his hometown Stockholm to Berlin that his career took a leap as well. After playing a couple of nights at different venues in Stockholm, he was invited to continue as a promoter, booking and DJ-ing on a monthly basis. The result was Art—ist, a beacon of electronic dance music in  Sweden.</p>

<p class="art-ist-text">Art—ist is known both for his productions and for his phenomenal energy-filled DJ-sets. His first major breakthrough as a producer came with the track “Bang” on Great Stuff Recordings. Plenty of releases have followed, currently Art—ist's own label Art—ist Recordings is his main focus. It’s been his project since 2014 with his first releases getting praise and plays from the likes of Radio Slave, Mr G, Laurent Garnier, Johanna Knutsson and Axel Boman.</p>

<p class="art-ist-text">As a DJ, Art—ist has a built a solid fan base with a strong set of roots in Stockholm but has played all the major venues in Sweden as well as Chalet, Sisyphos and Tresor in Berlin to name a few. With a sound consisting of an equilibrium of moon landing techno and broken, dirty house with a warm tape-based sound, Art—ist really distinguishes himself in both technique and selection.</p>

<h1>About this site</h1>

<p class="art-ist-text">When Art—ist asked me to develop this site for him the first thing i did was to listen to his music. His electronic music has it's origins in the underground movement of Stockholm and Berlin which leads to a quite dark sound.</p>

<p class="art-ist-text">When i asked him what he wanted the site to look like he told med that he wanted the site to look like what his music felt like. We both agreed that the site should have a dark monochrome color palette and that instead of having a lot of color in the sites elements themselves we would like the images to bring the colors into the site. A totally black site with images from different shows he's performed at will give this site the feeling he aims for.</p>

<p class="art-ist-text">To give the site a modern look we decided that the best choice when it comes to typography is a mix of the classic serif font he uses in his logo and something that feels a bit more modern, like the sans-serif Helvetica.</p>

<p class="art-ist-text">Art—ist made it clear that the main purpose of this site is to connect him with his fans through the blog function and to use it as a place through which people, bookers and managements can reach him.</p>
